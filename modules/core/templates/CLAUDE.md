## Doing the work

**Scope.** Do what was asked — not less, not more. Finish the tedious parts. An unrequested refactor
of adjacent code is a separate slice; something worth fixing outside the scope gets mentioned, not
done.

**Verification.** A change is done when it has been run, not when it has been written. Before
reporting completion: lint, typecheck, and the tests covering what changed. Report the real output —
if something fails, say so and show it; if a step was skipped, name it. "Should work" is not a result.

**Secrets.** Never commit them. All configuration comes from validated environment variables.

## Comments

The only comment that may exist in code is a `// TODO:` line — known-incomplete work, naming what
has to happen, in English; no block or doc-comment forms. Everything else lives elsewhere: the what in names, types, and structure; the
why and the invariants in ADRs, docs, and tests. If code seems to need explaining, rename it, split
it, or move the fact to the document that owns it; a reader left with a question raises it with the
owner, and an explanatory comment appears only when the owner asks for one. Tool directives that
are lexically comments — `@ts-expect-error` with its stated reason, suppressions like
`biome-ignore` — are directives, not comments, and follow their own rules.

## Documentation

Written documentation is in **{{docLanguage}}** — this file, `README`, ADRs, anything under `docs/`,
including headings and TODOs. Keep one fact in one place: link to the document that owns a subject
rather than restating it, because two copies of a fact become one stale copy.

Not in scope: identifiers and domain vocabulary, which follow the codebase they live in — do not
rename or translate them as a side effect of touching something else. Code comments are governed by
the Comments rule: English, whatever the documentation language.

## Module seams

- **Narrow interface, substantial implementation.** A module earns its place by hiding more than it
  exposes. A wrapper that forwards its arguments and adds nothing is not a seam — inline it.
- **Depend on the narrow port, not the concrete implementation.** Consumers declare the slice of
  behaviour they need; adapters satisfy it. This is what keeps test doubles typed and swaps cheap.
- **Extract on trigger, not on feeling.** Split a unit the moment any of these arrives:
  - a second consumer of the same logic,
  - a multi-step operation that must succeed or fail atomically,
  - conditional state transitions living inline in a caller,
  - a query or transformation whose correctness is not obvious on sight.

  Until a trigger fires, leave it inline. Premature splitting produces shallow fragments that are
  harder to follow than the code they replaced.

## Structure

- **The entrypoint wires; it declares nothing.** An entrypoint constructs the app's pieces, connects
  them, starts them, and handles boot failure — nothing else. It exports nothing, nothing imports it,
  and logic does not hide in it as inline callbacks: a handler body longer than a delegation is a
  declaration in disguise. A config object, interface, helper, or service class living in the
  entrypoint is a file that has not been created yet; a run-guard (`if __main__`, `process.argv`
  checks) is the file admitting it is two files. Scope: deployable apps — a single-file tool is its
  own entrypoint, and this rule begins once the program grows past one file.
- **A file is one role, and grab-bag names are not roles.** The filename states what the file holds;
  every top-level declaration fits that statement. `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `misc` state
  nothing — a declaration that only fits there is a declaration whose owner has not been found yet.
  Splitting follows the seam triggers above, not a count: a parser beside its error type is one
  role; a queue consumer beside an HTTP handler is two.
- **Config is one module per app.** The environment is read in exactly one place per app, validated
  at startup — named keys with types; a passthrough bag is not validation — and injected everywhere
  else. A default restated at a call site is a value with N owners: rotating it means finding all N,
  and missing one is silent. Any `process.env` / `os.environ` read outside the config module is a
  bug, entrypoint included. Same scope as the entrypoint rule: a single-file tool reading a variable
  is not an app.
- **Same-stack siblings share one skeleton.** Apps built on the same framework repeat one layout —
  same file names, same places, so a reader who knows one app knows them all. An app on a different
  stack follows that stack's idiom instead. Changing the skeleton is a recorded decision, not drift
  from the newest app.
- **Packages are entered through their surface.** Imports cross an app/package boundary only through
  the package's public entry point. Deep imports into internals and `export *` over another
  package's files dissolve the boundary. A surface is curated: a barrel that re-exports every
  internal file is not a surface but the absence of one — a package hides more than it exposes, same
  as any module. Direction is one-way: shared libs never import from apps; a lib that needs an app's
  type is a type that belongs in the lib.

## Layering

Decision logic must be callable without touching the network, disk, clock, or environment. Push I/O
to the edges and keep the middle pure. If exercising one branch needs a live database, the branch is
in the wrong place — that is the test telling you where the seam belongs.

## Fault tolerance

Handling an error where it happens is the easy half. This is about what the *system* does when a
part of it stops.

Every boundary that can fail — network, storage, queue, subprocess, external API — has an explicit
error path. No silently swallowed errors, no unhandled rejections. Retries are bounded, idempotent,
and time out.

For anything crossing a process boundary or persisting state, answer three questions before writing
it:

- **If this dies mid-operation, what is left behind?** Partial writes, orphaned jobs, held locks,
  half-finished uploads. Something has to reclaim them — name what.
- **If this runs twice, what breaks?** If the answer is "nothing", say why: an idempotency key, a
  conditional update, a unique constraint. "It won't run twice" is not an answer.
- **If a dependency is down for an hour, what happens?** Apply backpressure, degrade, or fail fast —
  pick one deliberately. Unbounded buffering is not a choice, it is a leak.

Data has an owner at every instant. The window where a record is written but not yet claimed, or
claimed but not yet durable, is where data goes missing — make it explicit and short.

## Tests

A slice that adds behaviour adds its tests in the same commit. Tests are deterministic: no wall
clock, no network, no dependence on execution order. Assert on observable behaviour, not internals —
a test that breaks when you rename a private method is a maintenance tax, not a check.

## Bugs

A fix that only makes the symptom go away is half the work. Name the root cause and the class it
belongs to, because the class decides what happens next:

- **The toolchain should have caught it** — missing lint rule, loose type, unvalidated boundary.
  Tighten the toolchain, same commit.
- **An uncovered case** — add the test that would have failed, same commit.
- **A wrong assumption about something external** — pin it with a test at that boundary whose name
  states what surprised you.
- **Ordering, concurrency, or lifecycle** — fix the immediate break, then *propose* the design change.
- **Architecture** — the seam is in the wrong place. Fix the break, propose the redesign, do not
  start it.

The last two are proposals, not work. A bug report is not authorization to refactor.
